# This script takes data from the Individual household electric power consumption
# Data Set in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
#
#    https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
#
# and examines how household energy usage varies over February 1st and 2nd in 2007.
# The script plots 4 different plots:  

#     1. Global Active Power (in kilowatts) over the two days
#     2. Voltage over the two days
#     3. Energy Sub-metering (1, 2, and 3 in watt-hour of active energy) over the two days
#     4. Global Reactive Power over the two days
# 
# Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).
#                 It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher,
#                 an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
#
# Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy).
#                 It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine,
#                 a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
#
# Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).
#                 It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
